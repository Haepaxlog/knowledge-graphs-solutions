## Task 2

1. Write a program that reads a directed graph from a file in the format of Exer-
cise 0.2 and prints out the graph in METIS graph format.

2. A triangle in a directed graph is a simple directed path v1 −→ v2 −→ v3 −→ v1.
Write a program that reads a directed graph G from a file in the format of Exercise 1.4 and
prints out the number of triangles in G. How does the runtime of your program scale with the
size of the input graph?
