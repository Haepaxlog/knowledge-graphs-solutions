## Task 1

1. Write a program that takes as input a directed graph in the format
given below, and prints out all vertices that have maximal out-degree. The input should be
read from a file given as a command-line argument.

Format: \
n \
s1 t1 \
s2 t2 \
... \
sn tn

2. Modify your program to compute the vertices of minimal in-degree instead.
